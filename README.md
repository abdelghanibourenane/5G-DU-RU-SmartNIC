# 5G_low-PHY_FFT
Implementationof  the 5G Remote Unit (RU) Low-PHY layer function through a hardware-software co-design approach on MPSoC FPGA. The focus is on different operating frequency configurations and the type of memory resources utilized. 
 The experimental findings indicate that employing high-performance external off-chip memory for FFT input samples read and output samples write leads to a reduction in FFT processing time and FPGA resource utilization compared to the use of an FPGA-internal block memory.
