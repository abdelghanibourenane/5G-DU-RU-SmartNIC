# A Programmable 5G DU-RU SmartNIC based on MPSoC FPGA
The adoption of disaggregated, virtualized, and open next-generation eNodeB (gNB) in the Next Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN) offers benefits such as cost reduction and improved network performance. However, meeting specific 5G requirements, e.g., Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC), requires offloading selected gNB functions onto accelerated Hardware (HW). Hence, this study proposes to implement a 5G Distributed Unit (DU)-Radio Unit (RU) into a System on Chip (SoC) that combines an ARM processor with a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Specifically, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) in uplink transmission has been offloaded. The implemented solution achieves 15× speedup in processing time when compared to a server’s CPU with FPGA-accelerated Low-PHY processing. Additionally, it is programmable and pluggable, allowing flexibility in function implementation and integration into various devices. Experimental results of the proposed solution show that employing High-Performance (HP) off-chip memory leads to about 14% reduction in processing time compared to the use of an FPGA-internal block memory.

 We target the ZYNQ Ultrscale + MPSoC FPGA family. This architecture features a dual-core ARM Cortex A-53 on the PS side, accompanied by an HP, multi-ported DDR Controller. This controller facilitates shared access to a common external DDR memory between the PS and the PL, operating at speeds of up to 2667Mbps. We target MPSoC FPGA which exhibits a heterogeneous architecture, comprising a PL and a PS with ARM-based processors. Our implementation comes with high integration and reduced latency due to utilizing Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) bus to facilitate high-bandwidth data transfer between PS and the PL. In this setup, SW tasks are executed on the processor, while the PL accommodates custom HW modules. HW Accelerators within the PL are activated by SW tasks through AXI requests whenever HW accelerated processing is required.
